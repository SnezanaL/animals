# Animal shelter

This is a full stack animal shelter application, or at least, it would be if it was finished! Most of the frontend and some of the backend is done. Help the animal shelter by completing the code so that these poor animals might get adopted. 🐶 🐱 🐀

## Task

There are two frontend files;

- [index.html](index.html) - the client facing page for the application
- [admin.html](admin.html) - the admin interface for the application

Both can be run using VS Code Live Server.

Your tasks are to create the API for managing the animals and extend the existing frontend code to make it work.

> Hint: To see what's missing in the code, look for the `// TODO` comments

This exercise is intentionally difficult and requires you to read the code and think about the application. You can do it!

## Requirements

- Look for the `// TODO` comments and complete the code
- Add the following endpoints

  - `GET /animal` - return all animals
  - `POST /animal` - create new animal
  - `PUT /animal/:id` - update an animal
  - `PATCH /animal/:id` - update an animal
  - `DELETE /animal/:id` - remove an animal
